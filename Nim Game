This is a classic game theory problem.
You and your friend take 1 to 3 stones per turn, and whoever removes the last stone wins.
You're playing optimally and you go first.


Stones (n)	Can Win?	Reason
1	✅ Yes	Take 1 stone, win.
2	✅ Yes	Take 2 stones, win.
3	✅ Yes	Take 3 stones, win.
4	❌ No	No matter what you take (1-3), opponent takes remaining and wins.
5	✅ Yes	Take 1 → leaves 4 → opponent loses.
6	✅ Yes	Take 2 → leaves 4 → opponent loses.
7	✅ Yes	Take 3 → leaves 4 → opponent loses.
8	❌ No	Any move leaves 5, 6, or 7 → opponent wins by pushing you to 4.
You can see a pattern:
If n % 4 == 0, you lose.
Otherwise, you can force the opponent into a losing position.


class Solution {
    public boolean canWinNim(int n) {
        
        if(n%4==0){
            return false;
        }
        else{
            return true;
        }
    }
}
